when lips feel indistinguishable 
from a stranger’s handshake or a quick pat
on the back, do you remember holding on? 
or how to remember running?

the length of a track field and back feels faster
than anyone can possibly collect any bodies
from here to mars looping back and back and through
the grates of the bonegrinder’s coffee machine
She helps me understand grave misuse.

but before looking into the aftermath of her gale, 
under the closest beam of the hottest sun, she wrestled
the dangerous burning star 
who, back then, had seen us ripen 

had witnessed and wept and shone
hot on the beaches; as it pushed 
and pulled and molded our one night 
After dripping itself between cracks in the day, all that day

that star whose dipped for us, plateaus and crushed
where i hid when i pretended nothing 
seemed to go right with you near.
so i’ve chosen to believe in how there are no accident orbits

in the third year, it was six sick words 
and a slice of small cake that cracked 
when the bugs slid btween the last remaining crops of the wet season. 

I accept hush money now which I spend on cotton for the back of a small pheasant as a remedy for the distance. 
there is no more flying and dancing and skipping forward into the part of the map I read upside down. 
just could not have followed you there.
