who, back then, had seen us ripen?

who had witnessed and wept 
and shone hot on the beaches; as it pushed 
and pulled and molded our one night 
After dripping itself between cracks in the day, all that day

a star whose dipped for us, plateaued and crushed
gold into sea glass sparkling

showing the path to where i hid when i pretended nothing 
seemed to go right with you near.
so iâ€™ve chosen to believe in how there are no accident orbits

in the third year, it was six sick words 
and a slice of small cake that cracked 
when the bugs slid btween the last remaining crops of the wet season. 

I accept hush money now which I spend on cotton for the back of a small pheasant as a remedy for the distance. 
there is no more flying and dancing and skipping forward into the part of the map I read upside down. 
just could not have followed you there.
