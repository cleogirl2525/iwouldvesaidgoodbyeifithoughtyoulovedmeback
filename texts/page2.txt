looking around and guessing wrong
on muted sounds, only searching
the barely listening, the sea
of wows and of whats

all i can remember is her hands, teasing and routine salutations
and polite compliments on my arm as if anyone would give this
look to any stranger

when she walked away, she left red
leather bread crumbs, fresh and fallen
empty in my open corner for her return

no one wants to get stuck in the wrong embrace
between us large living parallel cloud systems:
 hurricanes of electricity and hair
 hunder of twirls and maybes
 bright loose screw lighting that cracks
 coastal oaks into paper and pencils and nothing

can you recognize?
